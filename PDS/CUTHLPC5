%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

+      The %CUT+ command imposes a line limit  on its intermediate storage
+      areas, to prevent them from growing indefinitely.
+
+      If  a %CUT+ operation would cause its target storage area  to  grow
+      beyond its maximum number of lines,  then the command will  not  be
+      executed, but an error message will be produced instead.
+
+      Note that the limit applies only to the  number  of  lines  in  the
+      table that is involved in the  current %CUT+ operation;  any  lines
+      that you may have stored in  any  of  the  other  tables,  are  not
+      counted.  Also,  if you specify a  limit  that  is  less  than  the
+      current number of lines in the table, then no lines will be deleted
+      from the table.
+
+      The line limit must be an integer value from%100+to%9999.+ You will
+      most likely choose to omit it most of the time,  and allow the %CUT+
+      command to use the default line limit instead.  (You  can  use  the
+     %CUT DEFAULTS+or%PASTE DEFAULTS+command to verify this setting.)
