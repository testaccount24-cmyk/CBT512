+      The%PASTE+command will transfer lines from an intermediate  storage
+      area,  into which they were stored by the %CUT+ command.  Note that
+      the storage area is implemented  as  a  temporary  ISPF  table;  as
+      a consequence,  it will be cleared as soon as  you  exit  the  ISPF
+      environment.
+
+      The%CUT+and%PASTE+commands support  multiple  simultaneous  storage
+      areas.  Each storage area is identified  by  a  table  name,  which
+      consists of two alphanumeric  character  positions  (i.e.,  decimal
+      digits,  case-insensitive  letters,  or the symbols '#', '$', '@').
+      Note that for the numeric  table  names  '00'  to  '09',  only  the
+      rightmost character position, '0' to '9', need actually be typed.
+
+      One of the table names will be designated  as  the  default  table.
+      (You can use the%CUT DEFAULTS+or%PASTE DEFAULTS+command  to  verify
+      this setting.) %CUT+ and %PASTE+ will operate on this default table
+      unless you specify a different table name upon  invocation  (or  on
+      the panel displayed by the%CUT PROMPT+or%PASTE PROMPT+command).
