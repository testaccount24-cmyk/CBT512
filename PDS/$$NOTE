Subject:  CBT Contribution: Yet Another CUT and PASTE Implementation.

Hi Sam,

With this message, I send you a CUT and PASTE macro pair, which
you may want to consider for inclusion in a future version of
the CBT tape (even though, granted, there are already lots of
CUT and PASTE versions floating around).  I am returning to the
mainframe world, now that I have a new job, and I found the
development of these macros a nice way to get re-acquainted with
the platform.

Attached to this message is a CUTPASTE.ZIP archive (created with
WinZip 8.0) that contains a CUTPASTE.XMI file.  The CUTPASTE.XMI
file is a binary download, from the mainframe, of a sequential file
in XMIT format. The PDS from which the file was created, contains
panels (including tutorial help panels), a message member, and two
REXX scripts, which implement the macro pair.  There is also a
#README# member, which describes the macros, including installation
notes.

Hope you find my contribution useful (albeit not too original),
--Luc.
