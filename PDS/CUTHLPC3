+      The %CUT PROMPT +(or %CUT P)+ action will transfer a range of lines
+      from the current edit dataset into an  intermediate  storage  area.
+      It will present you with a panel,  to prompt you for  the  argument
+      values that you want to apply to the data transfer.  The panel will
+      have the following input fields:
+
+        %o  Action     -+Either%APPEND+or%REPLACE;+
+        %o  Table Name -+The  intermediate  storage  area  into which the
+                         data lines will be transferred;
+        %o  Line Limit -+The maximum number of  lines  that  the  storage
+                         area will be allowed to contain.
+
+      The panel will initially be filled in with your default%CUT+action;
+      the table name and line limit will also be set to  their  defaults,
+      unless you override them with alternative values upon invocation.
+
+      Once you are satisfied with the argument values,  just hit %<ENTER>+
+      to process them.  Otherwise, type the%END+command to cancel.
