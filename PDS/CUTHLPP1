%
+      The %PASTE CLEAR+ (or %PASTE C)+ action will insert the contents of
+      an intermediate storage area into the  current  edit  dataset.  The
+      storage area is identified by the%tablename+argument, and must have
+      been created by the%CUT+command.  The position where the data lines
+      are to be inserted,  must be specified by the familiar %A+("after")
+      or%B+("before") destination line commmand.
+
+      The intermediate storage area will be cleared once  the  lines  are
+      inserted,  provided that they all fit within the  destination  area
+      without truncation.  If one or more lines have to be truncated upon
+      insertion,  then the contents of  the  storage  area  will  not  be
+      affected.
+
+      The%PASTE CLEAR+command respects the current bounds  settings;  the
+      data will be inserted into the column positions  that  fall  within
+      the current bounds.
